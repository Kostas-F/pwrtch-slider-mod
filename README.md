### Project Summary

The PowerTech Sentry Eco (PTse) is a fairly popular choice of a feature phone for the elderly in my country. It is not without its problems but the implementation of a couple of features and decent localization puts it a step above other OEM solutions. Coupled with an affordable price it is used pretty widely. 

One interesting feature is the use of a locking slide button. It gets rid of the combination of keys and helps aliviate confusion. My issue however was that the slider was challenging to operate for someone with mobility limitations. It was recessed and needed a fair amount of dexterity to operate. See below for reference

Considering the fact that the SOS button does not function if the phone is locked and accidental pressed of buttons (or the SOS button itself) is an issue when the phone is in a pocket I thought it neccessary to design an easier to operate slider button.

#### BOM

You only really need to print/ have the button (pwrtech_button.stl ) printed. No support is needed.

#### Tools
You only need a PH00 screwdriver to take the phone apart (see Dissassembly).
