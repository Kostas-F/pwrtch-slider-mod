### Project Summary
<p allign="left"
The PowerTech Sentry Eco (PTse) is a fairly popular choice of a feature phone for the elderly in my country. It is not without its problems but the implementation of a couple of features and decent localization puts it a step above other OEM solutions. Coupled with an affordable price it is used pretty widely. 

One interesting feature is the use of a locking slide button. It gets rid of the combination of keys and helps aliviate confusion. My issue however was that the slider was challenging to operate for someone with mobility limitations. It was recessed and needed a fair amount of dexterity to operate. The power and flashlight sliders (pictured right) are identical>

Considering the fact that the SOS button _does not_ function if the phone is locked and accidental presses of buttons (or the SOS button itself) is an issue when the phone is in a pocket I thought it neccessary to design an easier to operate slider button.

##### BOM

* The button (see Printing Notes)

##### Tools
*  PH00 screwdriver to take the phone apart (see Dissassembly). 
*  A small file to bring the button down to tolerances if things are too tight
